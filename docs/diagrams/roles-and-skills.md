### Personal reflection
I chose Backend Engineer because they build the core systems. My skills are basic. Job market needs more advanced skills.

This semester I want to learn:

Docker - because every job asks for it

Microservices - because systems like Yandex Go use them

I will start with small projects using containers, then build simple services.
